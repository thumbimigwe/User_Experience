#The Design of Everyday Things- User-Centered Design
***
In his book, Norman uses the term "user-centred design" to describe design based on the needs of the user, leaving aside what he considers secondary issues like aesthetics.

User-centered design involves;
* simplifying the structure of tasks
* making things visible
* getting the mapping right
* exploiting the powers of constraint
* designing for error.


**User-centred design** (UCD) is a framework of processes (not restricted to interfaces or technologies) in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users of a product, service or process are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process.

User-centred design can be characterized as a multi-stage problem solving process that not only requires designers to analyse and foresee how users are likely to use a product, but also to test the validity of their assumptions with regard to user behavior in real world tests with actual users at each stage of the process from requirements, concepts, pre-production models, mid production and post production creating a circle of proof back to and confirming or modifying the original requirements. Such testing is necessary as it is often very difficult for the designers of a product to understand intuitively what a first-time user of their design experiences, and what each user's learning curve may look like.

For example, the user-centered design process can help software designers to fulfill the goal of a product engineered for their users. User requirements are considered right from the beginning and included into the whole product cycle. 

User-centred design answers questions about users and their tasks and goals, then uses the findings to make decisions about development and design.

User-centred design of a web site, for instance, seeks to answer the following questions:
* Who are the users of the document?
* What are the users’ tasks and goals?
* What are the users’ experience levels with the document, and documents like it?
* What functions do the users need from the document?
* What information might the users need, and in what form do they need it?
* How do users think the document should work?
* What are the extreme environments?
* Is the user multitasking?
* Does the interface utilize different inputs modes such as touching, spoken, gestures, or orientation?

###The Seven principles
___

How does the designer go about a task? As argued, the principles of design are straightforward. The following are _the Seven Key Principles_ for Transforming Difficult Tasks into Simple Ones.

1. Use both knowledge in the world and knowledge in the head
+ Simplify the structure of tasks
+ Make things visible: bridge the gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
+ Get the mappings right
+ Exploit the power of constraints, both natural and artificial.
+ Design for error.
+ When all else fails, standardize.
___

A Design should;
* Make it easy to determine what actions are possible at any moment
* make things visible.
* Make it easy to evaluate the current state of the system.
* Follow natural mapings beetween intentions and the required actions.

In-short, Make sure that the user can;
* Figure out what to do.
* Tell what is going on.
